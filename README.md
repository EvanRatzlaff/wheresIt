# wheresIt

WheresIt is a consumer-facing service that aims to provide its users a higher quality dining experience by utilizing geolocation to pinpoint the availability of a desired product in the nearest location to the user. 

This will be achieved by searching for the SKU number of the specified product to see if any restaurants carry the searched item and the amount of inventory available on that item. Other features that will be added in the future are the current wait time, and capacity percentage after calculating the ETA of the user.

The broader idea behind this project is to help direct traffic in highly populated areas. This will increase business for restaurants while also reducing the amount of traffic on the road during peak travel times by limiting the amount of individuals driving from place to place in search of their favorite beer/wine/shorter wait time.
